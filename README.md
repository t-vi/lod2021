These are the materials for the LOD 2021 PyTorch Tutorial.

Licensing: The idea is that you use what you learnt freely (including
copying code snippets) but don't steal my slides to do your own
courses without asking. Thank you.

Some of the code and images are owned by other parties, in particular
the notebook for the grapevine classification and some figures.
They are subject to their respective licenses.

The main notebook is
[pytorch_introduction.ipynb](pytorch_introduction.ipynb), I rendered
it as [slides](pytorch_introduction.slides.html), too, but you need to
clone the git repository to actually view them.

Thank you, Giuseppe Nicosia and the other organizers for having me.
Also thanks to the the participants who made the workshop a lot of
fun, and the interesting talks and conversations at the conference.
